<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The feature I picked was the coin flip. What I did was creating<br>an if statement and within that if statement I did if the user<br>or client typed the keyword &quot;flip&quot;, the program would execute the following lines.<br>By using the Math.random I was able to create an random integer that<br>if it was greater then 0.5, then a broadcast will show other clients<br>in the server that the user who typed &quot;flip&quot; flipped a coin and<br>either got heads or tails.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What feature did you pick? Briefly explain how you implemented it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The next feature that I did was rolling the die. I created another<br>method called Dice, which has four variables called dice1, dice2, result, and total.<br>Dice 1 and 2 and two dices. Result is going to be a<br>random integer of dice2. Total is going to output whatever number dice1 and<br>dice2 roll and add then together. By also following similar steps for the<br>flip problem, I created another keyword called &quot;roll&quot;. If one of the clients<br>enter roll they will have to also enter a number followed by a<br>&quot;d&quot; and then another number. The first number is the amount of dices<br>the user or client wants to roll and the number after &quot;d&quot; is<br>the max number the dices have. For example, if the user enters roll<br>3d6, it means they want to roll three times and the max number<br>on each dice is six. By splitting the message the first variable is<br>going to split the roll #d#, and put it inside an array. Then<br>the last variable is going to go inside the array from the first<br>variable and then separate d from #d#. Then we broadcast it showing that<br>the client what the result of rolling their die(s).<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Some issues I had was not knowing about using the broadcast command as<br>well as using the message.startsWith() command. Some ways that I was able to<br>solve that issue was going to the professor or messaging him. This led<br>to him explaining what was missing or helping me out on what was<br>going on. Another method that I used was looking through the sides as<br>I didn&#39;t really know how to properly compile and run the servers and<br>clients.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
